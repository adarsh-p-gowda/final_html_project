          >Smart Agriculture: CNN-Based Early Detection and Diagnosis of Plant
          Diseases:</b
        >
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Smart agriculture uses modern technologies like Convolutional Neural
        Networks (CNNs) to detect and diagnose plant diseases at an early stage.
        CNN is a type of deep learning model that works very well with images.
        In this system, images of plant leaves are captured using cameras or
        smartphones and then processed by a CNN model. The model analyzes color,
        texture, and shape patterns in the leaves to identify whether the plant
        is healthy or affected by a disease. Early detection helps farmers take
        quick action, reduce crop loss, minimize pesticide use, and improve
        overall yield. CNN-based plant disease detection systems are accurate,
        fast, and cost-effective, making them very useful for sustainable and
        smart farming practices.

      <dt><b>Netflix Clone:</b></dt>
      <dd>
        A Netflix Clone is a web application that replicates the basic features
        and user interface of Netflix. It allows users to browse movies and TV
        shows, view details like title, description, and ratings, and stream
        video content. The application usually includes user authentication, a
        homepage with categorized content (Trending, Popular, Originals), and a
        responsive design for different devices. Technologies like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, React, and Firebase are commonly used for the frontend and
        backend, while APIs such as TMDB (The Movie Database) are used to fetch
        movie data. A Netflix clone helps developers understand real-world
        concepts like UI design, API integration, authentication, and media
        streaming.
